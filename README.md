# phoenix-0

A small bit of automation to avoid remembering how to start a new Phoenix+Docker
project.

To see the help, just run `make`

To start a new project, run:

    make newapp APP=/path/to/newproject
    
You can then get into the project's directory and `make bash` to get dropped
into a bash shell in your new phoenix environment.
